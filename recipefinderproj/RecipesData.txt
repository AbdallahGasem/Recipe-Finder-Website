2 - appetizers:


1-Ingredients:
Mozzarella Sticks Recipe Ingredients: 12 sticks of mozzarella cheese 2 large eggs 1/4 cup milk 1 cup all-purpose flour 2 cups Italian-style breadcrumbs 1/2 cup grated Parmesan cheese 1 tablespoon dried Italian seasoning (optional) 1 teaspoon garlic powder 1 teaspoon onion powder Salt and pepper, to taste Vegetable oil, for frying Marinara sauce, for dipping
2-Instructions:
Prepare the Cheese Sticks: Unwrap the mozzarella sticks and cut each in half to create 24 shorter sticks. Place them on a baking sheet lined with parchment paper and freeze for at least 1 hour. This helps the cheese maintain its shape during frying. Set Up Breading Stations: In one shallow dish, mix the flour with a pinch of salt and pepper. In a second shallow dish, whisk together the eggs and milk until well combined. In a third shallow dish, combine the breadcrumbs, Parmesan cheese, Italian seasoning (if using), garlic powder, and onion powder. Bread the Cheese Sticks: Remove the frozen cheese sticks from the freezer. Roll each stick in the flour, ensuring it's fully coated. Shake off any excess flour. Dip the floured stick into the egg mixture, making sure it's completely covered. Roll the stick in the breadcrumb mixture, pressing lightly to ensure the breadcrumbs adhere well. For extra crispy mozzarella sticks, repeat the egg and breadcrumb coating process for a second layer. Freeze the Breaded Sticks: Place the breaded mozzarella sticks back on the baking sheet and freeze for at least 30 minutes. This step is crucial to prevent the cheese from oozing out during frying. Fry the Mozzarella Sticks: Heat about 1 inch of vegetable oil in a deep skillet or saucepan over medium-high heat until it reaches 350°F (175°C). You can test the oil by dropping a small piece of bread into it; if it sizzles and turns golden brown, the oil is ready. Carefully place a few mozzarella sticks into the hot oil, ensuring not to overcrowd the pan. Fry for about 1-2 minutes, turning occasionally, until they are golden brown and crispy. Use a slotted spoon to remove the sticks and place them on a plate lined with paper towels to drain any excess oil. Serve: Serve the mozzarella sticks hot with marinara sauce for dipping.
